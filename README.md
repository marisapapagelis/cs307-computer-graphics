# CS 307 Computer Graphics 
This repository contains all the assignments from Wellesley's Computer Graphics course (CS 307) in Spring 2022. The assignments consist of web-based computer graphics displays using software that integrates JavaScript, WebGL, and Three.js (3D library). The final project was created from scratch utilizing these techniques.
