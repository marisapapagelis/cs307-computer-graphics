<h3>Overview:</h3>
    <p>The goal of my project was to utilize computer graphics concepts learned from class to create a 3D, user-interactive game called Fish Tank Races. 
        To play, the user will continuously press '+' to advance all three fish towarrds the finish line. Each frame advances each fish forward by a 
        random integer value between 0 and 10, so the outcome of the race is unpredictable! The first fish to cross the finish line wins!

<h3>Inspiration:</h3>
<p>I wanted to recreate some sort of user-interactive game where players could try to bet on who was going to win. I 
    started with inspiration from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SPcmYymGb30">Desktop Derby</a> game, and I added a twist to make it fish rather
     than horses because I thought it would be fun to decorate a fish tank. I decided to add randomness to the game, 
    so the user can bet which fish they think will win.
</p>

<h3> Graphics Concepts: </h3>

<h4> 1. Modeling: </h4>
<p> I used a variety of basic geometries, such as spheres, cones, and tori, as well as additional complex curves and surfaces, 
    including Bezier curves and tubes, to model my fish tank scene. In doing so, I utlized hierarchical structuring to create 
different levels of objects using meshes. Then, I built on top of simpler objects to create a more complex design. </p>

<h4> 2. Material, Lighting, and Shading: </h4>
<p> I used Phong material for the creation of the fish, finish line, and rocks, adding shininess, 
    and specular properties where appropriate. For example, the rocks were set to be less shiny to give them 
    a more rough appearance. For the fish tank itself, I used Basic material for texture mapping (to be discussed
    later) and added the THREE.BackSide property to make only the inside of the fish tank visable at all angles.
     </p>

     <p>In terms of lighting, I used directional and ambient lights. The directional light is positioned
        on top of and in front of the fish tank.  </p>

<h4> 3. Camera: </h4>

<h4> 4. Curved Lines or Surfaces: </h4>
<p>I used Bezier curves to shape the finish line and the seaweed in my fish tank. I cloned and 
    manipulated each seaweed blade, so they would appear in bunches within my scene.   
    I used TubeRadialGeometry with increasing and decreasing radii throughout to give 
    the finish line a 'hanging' effect as a loosely draped finish line would look like.  </p>

<h4> 4. Textures and Texture-Mapping: </h4>
<p> I used loaded images to texture map the interior of the fish tank. The fish tank itself 
    uses a water pattern with repeat wrapping to give a continuous water flowing effect. For simplicity, the sand (floor) 
and celebration wall of the tank were created using texture-mapped one-sided planes positioned directly on top of their 
respective surfaces. The sand uses mirror repeated wrapping to create smooth water ripples in the sand. The celebration wall 
uses repeat wrapping in order to preserve the image of the celebration balloons.    </p>

<h4> 5. Transparency: </h4>

<h4> 7. User Interaction: </h4>
<p> User interaction is the central component of my project, and it can be implemented on many levels. First and foremost, 
    Fish Tank Races is a 3D user-interactive game. As described in the overview, the user can continuously press '+' in order 
    to advance the fish towards the finish line. With each press, the fish advance forward by a random integer value 
    between 0 and 10, so the outcome of the race is unpredictable. This ability was implemented through a function I created 
    called moveFish() which can be called using TW.setKeyboardCallback() and increments the x-position of each fish by a random 
    integer selected using Math.random(). When each fish passes the finish line, it will remain there until the others finish,
    so it doesn't swim outside of the tank. Once the first fish passes the finish line, text announcing the winner will appear on 
    the back wall of the fish tank. This text was implemented using a font loader and text geometry. [Reference images in Overview 
    section].
</p>

<code>// call moveFish() function each time + is pressed</code>
<br>
<code>TW.setKeyboardCallback('+', moveFish, "move fish forward");</code>
<br>
<br>
<code>// each fish advances by a random integer value between 0-10</code>
<br>
<code> sceneParams.fishX = sceneParams.fishX + Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);</code>
<br>
    <code>  sceneParams.fish2X = sceneParams.fish2X + Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);</code>
    <br>
        <code>  sceneParams.fish3X = sceneParams.fish3X + Math.floor(Math.random() * 11);</code>


<p> Additionally, the fish tank itself is a 3D object which can be moved around and zoomed-in on using the mouse. The interior 
    of the fish tank can be viewed from any angle imaginable, and the user-interactive game can be played at any angle of view.

<h3> Challenges:</h3>
<p>I faced many challenges in implementing the user-interactive component of my project. My moveFish() function, which advances the fish
    forward by random amounts had many tasks to fufill. First, when called, the function needed to move the x-position forward by a random 
    integer value between 0-10. In order to implement this, I needed to create a new function addFish() which takes in nine global input variables
    (corresponding to each fishes x,y,z position coordinates) and calls createFish() (my function to create a fish) three times. This replaced my original
    design of simply calling createFish() three times and hard-coding the starting position of each fish. With new global variables of each fishes position, 
    the fishes x-position could be incremented randomly with each key press.</p>
    <p>Next, I faced many challenges in figuring out how to deal with the winning fish.
     I wanted all of the fish to be able to cross the finish line without further ahead fish swimming through the boundary of the fish tank, so I created some 
     if statements to keep each fish at the finish line once they reached it. I defined crossing the finish line as when the origin of the head of the fish
     crossed the x-position of the finish line. </p>
     <p> I wanted to add text with the winner of the race, but I only wanted the text to appear
     once the first fish crossed the finish line, so I had to create a function that loaded the text and could be called once the first fish crossed. 
    At first, the text would reload each time a new fish crossed the finish line, with the most recent fish that crossed decleared as winner, even through
    that wasn't true. To fix this, I created an empty array called results outside of the moveFish() function. Each 
    time a new fish crossed the finish line, I pushed the fishes corresponding number into the array. When the text function was called, I indexed results[0], which is the first value in the array, and concatenated it
    with the text in order to display only the number of the winning fish. The second and third fish are in the results array (results[1] and results[2]), but they are not used in this project (yet?).</p>

<h3> Next Steps (For Final Version):</h3>
<p> For the final version of the project, I hope to implement the following:  </p>
    <ul>
  <li>Add distinctive text to either the fish or the starting wall to show which fish is fish 1, fish 2, and fish 3. </li>
  <li>Create some sort of scoreboard displaying the full results (first place, second place, third place).</li>
  <li>Implement preset camera angles for viewing, that can be activated through a keyboard press. </li>
  <li>Add transparency to the fish bubbles to make a more realistic bubble appearance. </li>
</ul>
